# Premium scales overrides plan

## Goal
Typed spending (a `$` amount or a `%` change on a destination category) stops freezing the "Expat price premium" slider. A typed value is pinned to the premium at the moment it was typed, and when the slider moves it scales the way eVelo's own estimate for that row moves: `value(e) = typed × model(e) / model(e_typed)`, capped at the larger of the home price and the typed value. Typed values read exactly as typed at their own premium and return to it when slid back. Rows the premium doesn't touch (pricier than home, Travel) don't move, and home-budget changes still don't move a `$`. Done = both stages pass verification in the running build, every view (plan card, Outlook, Atlas, profiles, simulation) shows the same numbers, and saved plans and share links from before load unchanged.

## Baseline
2026-11-10 · tests: 766 pass · typecheck: clean

## Now
Stage 1 of 2 · Scaling engine
Mode: autopilot
Agents: wide — confirmed 2026-11-10 10:25
Risk: user input (share-link and saved-plan decoding of the new anchors)
Checks:
- [ ] A `$` typed at premium e0 reads exactly as typed at e0; at another premium e it equals typed × model(e)/model(e0), capped at max(home amount, typed); back at e0 it's exact again (proof: test)
- [ ] A `%` override scales the same way, per city: each Atlas city scales by its own model ratio (proof: test)
- [ ] Rows the premium doesn't touch (model ratio ≥ 1, Travel) don't move with the slider; changing the home budget doesn't move a `$`; a model ratio of 0 at e0 doesn't divide by zero (proof: test)
- [ ] A saved plan or share link with overrides but no anchors loads with anchors = its own saved premium, so its numbers are unchanged; anchors from a share link are sanitized (known cities/categories, finite, clamped to 0–1) (proof: test)
- [ ] The simulation, Atlas odds, picks/profile spending, Outlook cost card, existing-loan check and plan card all compute from one shared function and agree (proof: test)
Open: none

## Stages
- [ ] 1. Scaling engine — anchors stored with each override, the scaling formula in one shared function used everywhere, migration and share-link sanitizing
- [ ] 2. Premium UI — overridden rows note they scale with the premium, info tip and Method copy updated, checked in the running app

## Decisions
- 2026-11-10 · A typed number means "a real price I found", not "my final spend": the premium still applies on top — user: "Meaning 2, go with option B and plan it".
- 2026-11-10 · Option B: pin a typed value to the premium when typed and scale it by the model's relative change, capped at max(home, typed); same for `$` and `%` — user chose option B. Replaces the standing 2026-11-08 decision that the premium doesn't move fixed amounts.
- 2026-11-10 · Agents: wide; run on autopilot — user: "Go wide and on autopilot."
- 2026-11-10 · Scale check didn't fire (2 stages, one release) — PM's call.
- 2026-11-10 · Anchors are stored beside the overrides (one premium per `%` category; one per city and category for `$`), not by changing the existing value types, so old share links and saved plans keep decoding — PM's call (default).
- 2026-11-10 · An override with no anchor (saved before this plan) takes the plan's own saved premium as its anchor at load, so nothing a user saved changes until they move the slider — PM's call (default).
- 2026-11-10 · Typing a new value re-anchors that row at the current premium; × and Reset all drop the anchors with the overrides — PM's call (default).
- 2026-11-10 · Stage 1's risk line drops "money": this is the planner's spending estimate (no payments, no real funds), which the same-shaped Set your own spending plan marked UI only; the formula is still proven by tests and the share-link decoding still gets the security pass — PM's call.
- 2026-11-10 · No per-row lock control ("final number, don't touch") for now — PM's call (default), revisit if asked.

## Open questions
- Touch-dragging the tablet's left Plan drawer doesn't close it (fails the same before stage 2; likely needs `touch-action: pan-y` on side sheets) — from the stage 2 build, later.
- The profile's tinted % marker overhangs the spending list's right edge by 4px (cosmetic, not clipped) — from the stage 1 verify, later.
- The preview build (claude.ai artifact) needs the 665 new 640px copies uploaded to its asset store before preview galleries use them; until then they fall back to the originals — from stage 2, next preview publish.
- Phones don't save photo bytes (DPR 3 needs the 1280); a 960px step or AVIF would — from the stage 2 verify, later.
- The Atlas worker pool (up to 6) stays alive for the page's life, and every superseding plan edit respawns all of it (each re-parses the 615 KB worker and rebuilds scenarios); shut it down after idle like `DestinationClient`, and keep idle workers on cancel — from the fix-round review, later.
- Scenario generation is paid once per Atlas worker; time `makeScenarios` against a shard's `runPaths` on a low-end phone before claiming the phone speedup — from the fix-round review, later.
- The idle prewarm starts the full-path ranking on up to 4 workers while the retire-in comparison still runs on the sim worker; each Atlas worker builds its own scenarios (~23 MB at 4,000 paths × 40 years, ~115 MB at 20k), so on a 4-core phone it may slow the comparison cards and raise memory. Measure on a real phone — from the stage 1 review, later.
- `peek()` re-parses the saved ranking (~15 KB JSON + two hashes) on every cache miss, e.g. each slider tick; cache the decoded value if profiling shows it — from the stage 1 review, later.
- On a phone, keyboard users swing ~684px per step press (Tab scrolls down to the next step, Enter brings the chart back): tier 3 by design — from the stage 2 verify, later if wanted.
- `useStoryPlayback` has no hook-level tests (vitest runs in node without testing-library); its logic is covered by pure tests and the e2e verify — from the stage 2 review, later.
- On phone, Buy shows two empty bands (reserved key rows and caption height), as the mockup does — from the stage 2 verify, later.
- Chart text falls under 11px below 360px viewports (320: 9.67px; 340: 10.45px) — from the stage 1 verify, later.
- The step titles were `h2` headings and are now button text, so they've left the heading outline — from the stage 1 verify, later.
- The comparison adds up to 5 simulates + 5 solves (+5 stay-home runs) per plan change on the main worker; on a 12-core desktop the verdict and Atlas times didn't move, but on a 2–4 core phone it may slow the Atlas fill. Measure on a real phone; if needed, run the comparison only while the Outlook is visible or at fewer paths — from the stage 4 verify, later.
- At 1100px `scrollWidth` reads 1137 because the verdict section (661px) overflows its 592px column; `overflow-x: clip` hides it, pre-existing — from the stage 4 fix, later.
- `chartKit.workingYears` and `src/ui/retire.ts` both compute the retirement age (built in parallel); dedupe — later.
- A $0 home category with no fixed amount reads "$0 ±0%" in the Outlook cost card while the plan card shows no % (cosmetic) — from the stage 2 verify, later.
- The Outlook cost card's "→" overlaps the home number at large home totals (~$174K) — pre-existing, from the stage 2 verify, later.
- Should the % override also become per-city? Today a "−33% housing" override applies to every Atlas city — user's call, later.
- Monthly entry ("1500/mo") in the amount field — later, if wanted.
- The shared Sheet restores focus to its opener on close; when the opener has re-mounted elsewhere (the docked pill when the drawer opens by browser Back/Forward while it holds focus), focus lands on `<body>`. Fall back when the restore target is disconnected — from the docked-verdict verify, later.
- Profile the Atlas slowdown on CI: since the opening-sale change (9e306b7) the success-only kernel loop runs ~30–50% slower on GitHub's runner (2.7–3.4 s vs 1.8–2.3 s for 80 cities), while locally only the first, cold run is slower. Suspects ruled out: the import, the per-path start values, the opening-sale call itself and the `initialLoan` expression. The CI budget was raised from 2500 to 3500 ms meanwhile — next plan.
- A plan that fails at once draws its fan y-axis as "$1 $1 $1 $0 $0 $0" (all-zero data), and the sale warning can say "$3.0M sold" on a $3.0M portfolio from rounding (pre-existing / cosmetic) — later.
- The LTV caption reads "peaks at 100%" when the median path breaks, because broken paths are recorded with LTV 1 (pre-existing) — later.
- Plans opened from a share link replace the recipient's own plan, including any existing loan balance, without a flag in the UI (`OPENED_FROM_LINK` exists); pre-existing for every input — later.
- Seoul, London, Amsterdam and Berlin have no `localTaxes.ts` entry (money logic, needs tests) — user's call, a later plan.
- Recheck Colorado Amendment 87 (Denver tax 5 → 4 if certified) and Florida Amendment 3 ("unofficial results" in four Florida profiles) once certified — later.
- The photo credit cleaner misses "upload on <date>" suffixes — later.
- Region chip rows (list and map) use `role="toolbar"` without arrow-key navigation; fix both or drop the role. The list chips also read region from context while the list reads it as a prop (consistent today) — later.
