# Dark by default plan

## Goal
The site opens in dark mode. Visitors with nothing saved start in Dark, and visitors whose saved theme is System are switched to Dark once; anyone who picked Light keeps it, and anyone who picks System after the switch keeps that. The toggle keeps its three options (System, Light, Dark). There's no flash of the light theme before the app loads. Done = the stage passes verification in the running app and the work is deployed on approval.

## Baseline
2026-11-09 · tests: 659 pass (44 files) · typecheck: clean

## Now
All stages done
Agents: wide — confirmed 2026-11-09 20:40

## Stages
- [x] 1. Dark by default — Dark as the starting theme, one-time switch of saved System, matching pre-paint script

## Decisions
- 2026-11-09 · Deployed: run 42753362297 succeeded (9m15s, the Pages deploy step was slow); the live site serves the same bundle as the local build and opens dark ([evidence](evidence/stage-1/deploy-live.txt)).
- 2026-11-09 · Deploy when the stage passes, no preview — user: "Go ahead and deploy when ready."
- 2026-11-09 · Stage 1 closed: 3/3 checks pass ([evidence](evidence/stage-1/report.md)), verified by a fresh agent briefed to return its report for the main session to save. Tests also run the real `index.html` pre-paint script against the same cases, so the two rules can't drift. No `keel:review`: UI only, a theme default with tests — PM's call.
- 2026-11-09 · Dark is the default theme — user: "Let's now have the site default to dark mode."
- 2026-11-09 · Visitors saved on System are switched to Dark once; Light is kept — user picked "Everyone on System".
- 2026-11-09 · The toggle keeps System, Light and Dark — user picked "Keep System".
- 2026-11-09 · The switch is marked by a `themeV: 2` field in the saved `evelo:v2` object: a saved System without it reads as Dark, with it as System. The pre-paint script in `index.html` applies the same rule — PM's call.
- 2026-11-09 · Scale check didn't fire (1 stage, one release) — PM's call.

## Open questions
- On a phone, keyboard users swing ~684px per step press (Tab scrolls down to the next step, Enter brings the chart back): tier 3 by design — from the stage 2 verify, later if wanted.
- `useStoryPlayback` has no hook-level tests (vitest runs in node without testing-library); its logic is covered by pure tests and the e2e verify — from the stage 2 review, later.
- On phone, Buy shows two empty bands (reserved key rows and caption height), as the mockup does — from the stage 2 verify, later.
- Chart text falls under 11px below 360px viewports (320: 9.67px; 340: 10.45px) — from the stage 1 verify, later.
- The step titles were `h2` headings and are now button text, so they've left the heading outline — from the stage 1 verify, later.
- The comparison adds up to 5 simulates + 5 solves (+5 stay-home runs) per plan change on the main worker; on a 12-core desktop the verdict and Atlas times didn't move, but on a 2–4 core phone it may slow the Atlas fill. Measure on a real phone; if needed, run the comparison only while the Outlook is visible or at fewer paths — from the stage 4 verify, later.
- At 1100px `scrollWidth` reads 1137 because the verdict section (661px) overflows its 592px column; `overflow-x: clip` hides it, pre-existing — from the stage 4 fix, later.
- `chartKit.workingYears` and `src/ui/retire.ts` both compute the retirement age (built in parallel); dedupe — later.
- A $0 home category with no fixed amount reads "$0 ±0%" in the Outlook cost card while the plan card shows no % (cosmetic) — from the stage 2 verify, later.
- The Outlook cost card's "→" overlaps the home number at large home totals (~$174K) — pre-existing, from the stage 2 verify, later.
- Should the % override also become per-city? Today a "−33% housing" override applies to every Atlas city — user's call, later.
- Monthly entry ("1500/mo") in the amount field — later, if wanted.
- The shared Sheet restores focus to its opener on close; when the opener has re-mounted elsewhere (the docked pill when the drawer opens by browser Back/Forward while it holds focus), focus lands on `<body>`. Fall back when the restore target is disconnected — from the docked-verdict verify, later.
- Profile the Atlas slowdown on CI: since the opening-sale change (9e306b7) the success-only kernel loop runs ~30–50% slower on GitHub's runner (2.7–3.4 s vs 1.8–2.3 s for 80 cities), while locally only the first, cold run is slower. Suspects ruled out: the import, the per-path start values, the opening-sale call itself and the `initialLoan` expression. The CI budget was raised from 2500 to 3500 ms meanwhile — next plan.
- A plan that fails at once draws its fan y-axis as "$1 $1 $1 $0 $0 $0" (all-zero data), and the sale warning can say "$3.0M sold" on a $3.0M portfolio from rounding (pre-existing / cosmetic) — later.
- The LTV caption reads "peaks at 100%" when the median path breaks, because broken paths are recorded with LTV 1 (pre-existing) — later.
- Plans opened from a share link replace the recipient's own plan, including any existing loan balance, without a flag in the UI (`OPENED_FROM_LINK` exists); pre-existing for every input — later.
- Seoul, London, Amsterdam and Berlin have no `localTaxes.ts` entry (money logic, needs tests) — user's call, a later plan.
- Recheck Colorado Amendment 87 (Denver tax 5 → 4 if certified) and Florida Amendment 3 ("unofficial results" in four Florida profiles) once certified — later.
- The photo credit cleaner misses "upload on <date>" suffixes — later.
- Region chip rows (list and map) use `role="toolbar"` without arrow-key navigation; fix both or drop the role. The list chips also read region from context while the list reads it as a prop (consistent today) — later.
